(C) Implicit Graph Search Library, 2009, 2013

=== RELEASE NOTES, version 0.2.3 ===

Release contains examples only for new IGSL interfaces for constraint-satisfaction problems.
As usual it contains IGSL classes packed into igsl.jar which could be found in lib directory.
Generated IGSL core interfaces' and traversal's implementations' documentation could be
found in javadoc directory. Compiled IGSL demo applications Coin Problem, Hamiltonian Path and
Eight Queens problems along with tests using them are presented in bin directory. Java code for demo
applications and tests is presented in app directory.

For Coin problem:

java -classpath <IGSL_location>/lib/igsl.jar;<IGSL_location>/bin org.igsl.test.coinproblem.variant3.CoinProblemTest

For Hamiltonian Path problem:

java -classpath <IGSL_location>/lib/igsl.jar;<IGSL_location>/bin org.igsl.test.hamiltonianpath.HamiltonianPathTest

For Eight Queens problem:

java -classpath <IGSL_location>/lib/igsl.jar;<IGSL_location>/bin org.igsl.test.eightqueens.EightQueensTest

Samples' classes are already compiled into bin directory.
