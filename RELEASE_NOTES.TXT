=== RELEASE NOTES, version 0.2.1 ===

Release is intermediate and contains examples both for old and new IGSL interfaces.
As usual it contains IGSL classes packed into igsl.jar which could be found in lib directory.
Generated IGSL core interfaces' and traversal's implementations' documentation could be
found in javadoc directory. Compiled IGSL demo applications Coin Problem, Hamiltonian Path
and Knight's Tour problems along with tests using them are presented in bin directory.
Java code for demo applications and tests is presented in app directory.

For Coin problem:

java -classpath <IGSL_location>/lib/igsl.jar;<IGSL_location>/bin org.igsl.test.coinproblem.variant3.CoinProblemTest

For Hamiltonian Path problem:

java -classpath <IGSL_location>/lib/igsl.jar;<IGSL_location>/bin org.igsl.test.hamiltonianpath.HamiltonianPathTest

For Knight's Tour problem:

java -classpath <IGSL_location>/lib/igsl.jar;<IGSL_location>/bin org.igsl.test.knighttour2.KnightTourTest

Samples' classes are already compiled into bin directory.
