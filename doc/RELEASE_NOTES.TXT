(C) Implicit Graph Search Library, 2009, 2010

=== RELEASE NOTES, version 0.1.6 ===

Release contains IGSL classes packed into igsl.jar which could be found in lib directory.
Generated IGSL core interfaces' and traversal's implementations' documentation could be
found in javadoc directory. A sample dedicated to Sudoku, Eight Knights and Traveling Salesman
Person in planar statement problems are presented with source files located in app directory.
For A* demo a Fifteens Puzzle solver is presented in app directory.

To run the Traveling Salesman Person sample please try

java -classpath <IGSL_location>/lib/igsl.jar;<IGSL_location>/bin org.igsl.app.tsp.TSPSolver

For Eight Knights problem:

java -classpath <IGSL_location>/lib/igsl.jar;<IGSL_location>/bin org.igsl.app.eightknights.EKPSolver.

For Sudoku problem:

java -classpath <IGSL_location>/lib/igsl.jar;<IGSL_location>/bin org.igsl.app.sudoku.SudokuSolver.

For Fifteens Puzzle solver:

java -classpath <IGSL_location>/lib/igsl.jar;<IGSL_location>/bin org.igsl.app.fifteens.FifteensSolver.

Samples' classes are already compiled into bin directory.

What does the release contain?

- A basic interfaces with TreeTraversal as a cornerstone of IGSL.
- A depth-first traversal with/without cost implementations.
- A best-first traversal along with A* implementation.
- A recursive best-first tree traversal.
- A set of well-known direct and iterative algorithms, such as depth-first search, branch-and-bound
technique, iterative deepening. Two classes - org.igsl.algorithm.Direct and org.igsl.algorithm.Iterative are
the best as a start point to understand IGSL idea.
- Techniques to enhance traversals' performance by memoizing basic interfaces' functions.
- A traveling salesman person problem and eight knights problem solver as IGSL application samples' for
search on a graph with costs and constraint-satisfaction programming correspondingly. For traveling
salesman problem a minimum 1-tree heuristics presented.
- A Fifteens Puzzle solver as IGSL application utilizing A* implementation.
- A Sudoku solver as IGSL application utilizing constraint-satisfaction programming techniques.
