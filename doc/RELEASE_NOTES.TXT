(C) Implicit Graph Search Library, 2009

=== RELEASE NOTES, version 0.1.3 ===

Release contains IGSL classes packed into igsl.jar which could be found in lib directory.
Generated IGSL core interfaces' and traversal's implementations' documentation could be
found in javadoc directory. A sample dedicated to Eight Knights problem and Traveling Salesman
Person problem in planar statement are presented with source files located in app directory.

To run the Traveling Salesman Person sample please try

java -classpath <IGSL_location>/lib/igsl.jar;<IGSL_location>/bin org.igsl.app.tsp.TSPSolver

For Eight Knights problem:

java -classpath <IGSL_location>/lib/igsl.jar;<IGSL_location>/bin org.igsl.app.eightknights.EKPSolver.

Samples' classes are already compiled into bin directory.

What does the release contain?

- A basic interfaces with TreeTraversal as a cornerstone of IGSL.
- A depth-first traversal with/without cost implementations.
- A set of well-known direct and iterative algorithms, such as depth-first search, branch-and-bound
technique, iterative deepening. Two classes - org.igsl.algorithm.Direct and org.igsl.algorithm.Iterative are
the best as a start point to understand IGSL idea.
- A traveling salesman person problem and eight knights problem solver as IGSL application samples' for
search on a graph with costs and constraint-satisfaction programming correspondingly.
