(C) Implicit Graph Search Library, 2009

=== RELEASE NOTES, version 0.1.2 ===

Release contains IGSL classes packed into igsl.jar which could be found in lib directory.
Generated IGSL core interfaces' and traversal's implementations' documentation could be
found in javadoc directory. A sample dedicated to Traveling Salesman Person problem in planar
statement is presented with source files located in app directory.

To run the sample please try

java -classpath <IGSL_location>/lib/igsl.jar;<IGSL_location>/bin org.igsl.app.tsp.TSPSolver

with samples' classes already compiled into bin directory.

What does the release contain?

- A basic interfaces with TreeTraversal as a cornerstone of IGSL.
- A depth-first traversal implementation.
- A set of well-known direct and iterative algorithms, such as depth-first search, branch-and-bound
technique, iterative deepening. Two classes - org.igsl.algorithm.Direct and org.igsl.algorithm.Iterative are
the best as a start point to understand IGSL idea.
- A traveling salesman problem solver as a sample IGSL application.
